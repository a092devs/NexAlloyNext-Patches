# Changelog

All notable changes to the NexAlloyNext patch bundles are documented here. Releases are dispatched
automatically on every push to `main` for the version of the first `X.Y.Z` section below when that
version has no release yet. The section matching the release tag becomes the release notes,
falling back to generated commit notes when no section exists. Android CI
validates changes; the dedicated release workflow builds and publishes release
bundles after CI succeeds.

  * Resilient Setter Resolution: Resolved `BrowseFragmentSetterMethod` matching failure by dynamically locating the endpoint assignment instruction and adding safe fallback handling.

  * Gboard Suggestion Strip & Preferences: SharedPreferences hook now preserves existing user preferences instead of overwriting them on startup, preventing preference resets on force-stop. Proactive suggestion strip close button disabled by default to keep the suggestion row persistently accessible.

  * YouTube 21.42.243 Compatibility: Resolved startup crashes and restored stability across patches on YouTube 21.42.243.

    - Gemini Rambler Dictation Prompt Fix: Restores verbatim spoken transcripts into the committed text span and resets agentic intent (intent 0) whenever Rambler misclassifies speech as an AI prompt instruction, ensuring speech-to-text always types what was spoken.
    - Signature Verification Bypass: Added `Signature verification bypass` patch targeting `sfr` (18.5.3/18.5.4), `ryi` (18.4.1), `rvl` (18.3.1), and `rpv` (18.0.3) to allow offline speech and AI models to load cleanly.

    - AI Writing Tools All Languages: Unlocked all languages and locales for Gemini AI writing tools and Proofread (`*` language tags allowlist).
    - Speech Pack Download Loop Guard: Added Language Download Guard preventing infinite download request retry loops in speech services.
    - Samsung One UI & Vivo Clipboard Sync: Hooked foreground IME focus and `ClipboardDataHandler` (`frc.ft` / `fml.ft`) to guarantee primary clip capture.

## 3.4.6

- `NexFusion` 3.4.6:
  * Meta AI Removal: Completely removed Meta AI integration across Facebook and Instagram:
    - Facebook: Suppressed search Meta AI answer cards (`meta_ai_answer_entities`), Ask Meta AI question pills under feed posts (`GenAiDeepDivePillPlugin`), GenAI photo CTA chips (`GenAiDeepDiveCtaPlugin`), GenAI comment summaries (`InlineCommentSummaryWithGenAIPlugin`), and Meta AI feed unit edges.
    - Instagram: Intercepted and blocked low-level MobileConfig flags (`0x81067100111e9fL`, `0x81040c0006109dL`, `0x81040a001b1093L`, `0x81168700017258L`, `0x8110c200115a92L`), redirected all Meta AI / GenAI network endpoints (`/meta_ai`, `/genai`, `/aistudio`, `/muse`, `/hatch`), and added runtime view hiders for all Meta AI buttons, search pills, rings, badges, and composer items.
  * Facebook Hush Features: Ported `Don't save search history` (stops search history tracking and keeps visited profiles/pages out of search history via `FB4ASearchTypeaheadAddRecentSearch` and Falco privacy analytics suppression), `Don't send reel watch history` (suppresses `FbShortsSeenStateMutation` GraphQL batches), `Longer music on photo stories` (allows photo story music clips to play for up to 30 seconds instead of 15), and `Hide profile notes` (hides profile picture note bubbles) from Hushfacebook.
  * Instagram Hush Features: Ported `Don't save recent searches` (intercepts `/fbsearch/register_recent_search_click/` via Tigon), `Don't send reel watch history` (intercepts `/clips/write_seen_state/` via Tigon), and `Hide Follow on feed posts` (removes Follow and Subscribe buttons from feed post headers) from HushGram.
  * Compatibility Targets: Verified support for Facebook 584 (`com.facebook.katana-584.0.0.51.56`) and Instagram 452 (`com.instagram.android-452.1.0.53.64`).

## 3.4.5

- `NexFusion` 3.4.5:
  * YouTube Patch Fixes: Resolved failing patches on YouTube 21.42.243. Added `@StrictQuery` filtering to `ReelPlaybackRepeatFingerprint` in `SkipLiveShortsPatch` to isolate the exact reel repeat handler, and added resilient fallback for caption track event handling in `CaptionsInPipPatch` for 21.42+ where track event routing was refactored.
  * Classic YouTube 5-Tab Navigation: Fully restored the classic 5-tab bottom navigation (`Home`, `Shorts`, `+`, `Subscriptions`, `You`) via dynamic runtime injection, ensuring the Subscriptions tab is present and accessible. Removed redundant top category filter chips ("Podcasts", "Live", "Music", etc.) from the Home feed header.
  * Seekbar Tap-to-Seek & Slide-to-Seek: Added `Enable tap to seek`, `Enable slide to seek`, and `Disable precise seeking gesture` patches to restore classic tap-anywhere seekbar navigation and prevent unwanted fullscreen precise-seeking drawer expansion.
  * Compatibility Targets: Added support for Facebook 584 (`584.0.0.51.56`) with verified feed and reels ad-blocking finders.
  * Codebase Maintenance: Cleaned up temporary test probes and investigation files, ensuring clean repository trees and reliable release bundle generation.

## 3.4.4

- `NexFusion` 3.4.4:
  * Unified Patch Bundle: Merged YouTube, YouTube Music, and Google Photos directly into NexFusion, retiring the separate `bundles/nexalloy` bundle to consolidate all 15 supported applications into a single, unified patch bundle (`nexfusion-3.4.4.nxb`).
  * Classic YouTube Navigation: Fully restored the classic 5 bottom tabs layout (`Home`, `Shorts`, `+`, `Subscriptions`, `You`) and phone header chips ("All", "Podcasts", "Gaming", etc.) by purging Automotive Guide spoofing from `NavigationBarPatch`.
  * YouTube SponsorBlock: Restored `PlayerTypeFingerprint` and `ReelWatchPagerFingerprint` in `PlayerTypeHookPatch`, ensuring player types are tracked in real-time, `playerState().isPlayerTypeNoneOrHidden()` evaluates accurately, and automated segment skipping operates seamlessly.
  * YouTube Settings & About Screen: Updated branding to "NexAlloyNext", updated repository link to `https://github.com/a092devs/NexAlloyNext`, developer attribution to `@a092devs`, and Telegram to `https://t.me/a092devs`. Removed Discord, Donate, and Morphe API fetch buttons.
  * Verified App Targets: YouTube `21.42.243`, `21.41.525`, `21.40.161`, `21.39.522`; YouTube Music `9.33.00`; Instagram `452.1.0.53.64`; LinkedIn `4.1.1264`; Facebook `583.0.0.39.55`; Discord `350.8`; Proton VPN `5.20.98.0`; X `12.36.1-prod.01`; Reddit `2026.42.0`. All unit and compatibility tests pass.

## 3.4.3

- `NexAlloy` 1.0.15:
  * YouTube Client Identity & Layout: Completely eliminated internal `isAutomotive` context overrides and InnerTube `osName: "Android Automotive"` endpoint spoofing from `HideAdsPatch` and `AdsFilter`. YouTube operates strictly as a standard Android phone client, fully restoring the native portrait video player, classic 5-tab bottom navigation (`Home`, `Shorts`, `+`, `Subscriptions`, `You`), and eliminating tablet/dashboard split mode.
  * YouTube Watch History: Fully restored user Watch History shelf (`library_recent_shelf` / `FEhistory`) on the "You" tab and continuous playback tracking by serving standard Android InnerTube browse and player payloads.
  * Preferences Defaults Migration: Added one-time migration (`nexalloy_defaults_migrated_v4`) in `Settings.java` resetting stale stored preferences on existing installs (`swap_create_with_notifications` -> false, `hide_horizontal_shelves` -> false, `hide_get_premium` -> true, `hide_youtube_premium_menu` -> true, `hide_shorts` -> false, `hide_subscriptions` -> false, `hide_create` -> false).
  * SponsorBlock Controls: Re-enabled standard controls overlay bindings (`size_adjustable_youtube_controls_overlay`), allowing SponsorBlock skip buttons, segment markers, and automated skip logic to seamlessly render on the phone player layout.
  * Settings Branding & Links: Updated Morphe About dialog branding to "NexAlloyNext", updated links to developer GitHub repository (`https://github.com/a092devs/NexAlloyNext`), developer profile (`https://github.com/a092devs`), and Telegram (`https://t.me/a092devs`), and removed legacy third-party donation links.
- `NexFusion` 3.4.3:
  * Developer Attribution: Cleaned legacy developer references across Spotify and media session modules, aligning attribution with `a092devs`.

## 3.4.2

- `NexAlloy` 1.0.14:
  * YouTube Layout & Navigation: Restored classic 5 bottom tabs layout (Home, Shorts, Subscriptions, Create/Notifications, You) by defaulting `morphe_swap_create_with_notifications_button` to `false`, preventing unintended Android Automotive Guide client spoofing.
  * YouTube Premium Promos: Defaulted `morphe_hide_get_premium_button` and `morphe_hide_youtube_premium_menu` to `true`, cleanly hiding "Get Premium" promotions from the You tab page header (`SPunlimited`) and navigation menus.
  * YouTube Watch History: Restored Watch History shelf on the "You" tab by setting `morphe_hide_horizontal_shelves` default to `false` and preserving `FEhistory` shelf visibility.
  * YouTube 21.42+ Feature Flag Override: Added `experimentalIndexedBooleanFeatureFlagFingerprint` (`(I, J, Z) -> Z`) support to `FeatureOverride` and `EnableDebuggingPatch`, ensuring all runtime boolean feature flag overrides take effect on YouTube 21.42+.
  * Extension Class Loading: Switched to framework inflation entry-point hooks (`LayoutInflater.createView`, `DrawableInflater.inflateFromClass`, and `Fragment.instantiate`) for module UI classes, preserving the host ART ClassLoader hierarchy without parent delegation interference.
- `NexFusion` 3.4.2:
  * Instagram: Added target `452.1.0.53.64` to `Instagram` targets in `NexFusionPatches.kt`, resolving status from "Untested" to "Compatible".
  * LinkedIn: Added target `4.1.1264` to `LinkedIn` targets in `NexFusionPatches.kt`, resolving status from "Untested" to "Compatible".

## 3.4.1

- `NexAlloy` 1.0.13:
  * YouTube SponsorBlock: Resolved critical playback time tracking failure on YouTube 21.42+. Fixed `PlayerControllerSetTimeReferenceFingerprint` opcode filter mismatch to accurately bind the `arcb.<init>` constructor hook, restoring real-time playback position ticks to `videoTimeHooks` and re-enabling automated SponsorBlock segment skipping.
- `NexFusion` 3.4.1:
  * Instagram: Verified compatibility with `com.instagram.android` 452.1.0.53.64 (reels, stories, media download hooks pass with zero errors).
  * LinkedIn: Verified target class and method references (`NavigateToUrlActionViewData`, `RichTextUtils.getLinkShimmingLink`, `MetricQueue.queueMetric`, `ConversationListItemTransformer`, `sendTypingIndicator`, `updateConversationReadStatus`, `ClickActions`, `ComponentTransformer`, `CollectionTemplate`) on `com.linkedin.android` 4.1.1264.
  * Comprehensive Suite Verification: Confirmed 100% test pass rate across YouTube, Spotify, Reddit, Facebook, Discord, Mixplorer, ProtonVPN, and Twitter target binaries.

## 3.4.0

- `NexFusion` 3.4.0:
  * Settings UI: Fixed `sortPreferenceGroups` NullPointerException when encountering null-key preference groups or null items, adding full null-safety with collation fallback and automated regression tests.
  * Patch Set Curation: Completely removed discontinued patches (`Kleinanzeigen`, `Untappd`, and `InterPals`) along with their exclusive resources, tests, and build definitions.
  * NexFusion Modernization: Relocated remaining `2eno` extension packages (googleads, shared, spotify) to `io.github.nexalloy.nexfusion.extension`, unified runtime logger tag to NexFusion, and preserved upstream attribution.
  * Reddit: Added `RedgifsAudioPatch` for unmuting embedded Redgifs audio streams on Reddit 2026.42.0+.
  * Upstream Feature Ports: Integrated Picture-in-Picture captions toggle, Skip Live Shorts filter, Ambient Mode override controls, and Video Delay adjustments.
  * Build & CI: Submodule pointers and public fork references updated to ensure fully reproducible, verified CI builds.
- Build: Removed the duplicated local `build-logic` copy and pinned the
  `nexalloy.bundle` plugin to the version published by NexAlloyNext.
- CI: Kept validation in the Android workflow and restored a dedicated release
  workflow for reproducible release builds and publishing.
- Security: Added repository secret scanning and documented handling for
  client-side API keys and release signing identity.

## 3.3.10

- `NexFusion` 3.3.10:
  * Gboard: Removed the forced `show_suggestion_strip` override. The suggestion-strip toggle is a genuine user preference again and no longer resets on every Gboard start; the writing-tools patch only seeds the keys it actually needs. If the strip is currently forced on, turn it off once after updating — the choice now persists.
  * Reddit: Added support for Reddit 2026.42.0 and verified every Reddit fingerprint against it (release of October 16, 2026). Target list now includes 2026.42.0, 2026.41.0, 2026.38.0 and older builds.
  * Spotify: Ported Femify's "Show unplayable songs" patch. It forces `show_unavailable_tracks` on every freshly built settings state, so tracks that cannot be played (wrong market, removed, …) stay visible in collections instead of being hidden. Anchors verified against Spotify 9.1.90.2270 and 9.1.92.3058.
  * Spotify: The "songs skip after about 9 seconds" behavior is a server-side account restriction. Femify's updated source contains the same attribute overrides as NexFusion and no client-side fix, and ReVanced's removed "Spoof client" patch cannot be ported to runtime hooks. `Unlock Spotify Premium` stays opt-in, and its description now warns about the 9-second cutoff.

## 3.3.9

- `NexAlloy` 1.0.12:
  * YouTube: Added `is_21.38_or_greater` and `is_21.40_or_greater` version flags for YouTube 21.38+ and 21.40+ compatibility.
  * YouTube: Added `readsResourcesWithParser` support to `ElementProtoParserHookPatch` for YouTube 21.40+ inline resource handling (template/JS module bytes).
  * YouTube: Made `timeMethod` hook optional in `VideoInformationPatch` so the patch still applies even when the fingerprint doesn't match on YouTube 21.42+, preventing cascade failures to SponsorBlock and other dependent patches.
  * YouTube: Added `name` parameters to all YouTube dependency patches (`PlayerResponseMethodHook`, `VideoId`, `VideoInformationPatch`, `PlayerTypeHook`, `LegacyPlayerControls`, `PlayerControlsOverlayVisibility`, `conversionContextPatch`, `textComponentPatch`) for clearer patch status reporting.
- `NexAlloy` 1.0.11:
  * YouTube: Fixed `FixVerticalScrollPatch` fingerprint for YouTube 21.42+ by resolving direct `canScrollVertically` call on obfuscated `SwipeRefreshLayout` and adding resilient catch handler to prevent cascading `LithoFilter` hook initialization failure.
  * YouTube: Updated `experimentFlagUtilFingerprint` and flag accessor fingerprints for YouTube 21.42+ three-parameter method shape (`listOf("I", "J", ...)`).
  * YouTube: Added 21.42+ compatibility check in `VersionCheckPatch`.
  * YouTube: Constrained bottom navigation bar IME padding growth.
- `NexFusion` 3.3.9:
  * Instagram: Redesigned Downloader UI to match Facebook's seamless experience with direct 1-tap rows for Reel, Audio, Photo, and Album downloads.
  * Gboard: Fixed AI Writing Tools (`jarvis`) toolbar access point ordering and Phenotype flag integration so writing tools appear directly on the keyboard toolbar.
  * App Compatibility: Added support and verified hooks for Discord 350.8, LinkedIn 4.1.1263, Proton VPN 5.20.98.0, and X 12.36.1-prod.01.
  * Proton VPN: Added suppression for telemetry and background workers.

## 3.3.8

- `NexFusion` 3.3.8:
  * Facebook: Full media download implementation for Facebook 583.0.0.39.55:
    - Photo Viewer: Unlocked native "Save to phone" action with high-resolution JPEG extraction.
    - Reels: Integrated native one-tap "Download reel" and "Download audio" controls directly into the Reel controls sheet using authentic Facebook FDS download glyphs (`X.1Uf.A8L`), supporting progressive and DASH track extraction.
    - Stories: Unlocked native story save capability across all stories.
    - Post Menus: Added theme-aware media download actions to post overflow sheets.
    - Privacy: Sponsored feed story filtering via server value, sponsored reel suppression, and ad telemetry blocking.
  * Reddit: Consolidated Reddit into NexFusion. Added "Hide Reddit ads", "Sanitize Reddit sharing links" and "Start Reddit as guest" alongside existing Reddit patches, removing dual-bundle duplication.
  * Instagram: Added support for Instagram 452.0.0.48.64 and verified sheet-menu anchors. Added DASH manifest test suite.
  * Discord: Added support for Discord 349.9; all 135 privacy targets resolve against the installed APK.
- `NexAlloy` 1.0.10:
  * Reddit: Removed from this bundle; all Reddit patches now live exclusively in NexFusion.

## 3.3.3

- `NexFusion` 3.3.3:
  * Instagram: Fixed the remaining Instagram 452 runtime failures. The sheet-menu row adder now accepts 451's five-parameter shape and 452's four-parameter shape, and the carousel position fingerprint follows 452's `List.get` decode. Download options install in the reels and feed sheets again, and carousel downloads use the item on screen.
  * Instagram: Fingerprint tests now assert the sheet-menu row adder and carousel position field for every APK in `binaries/`.

## 3.3.2

- `NexFusion` 3.3.2:
  * Instagram: Verified every patch anchor against Instagram 452.0.0.48.64. The story menu row and highlight menu builder now resolve their classes from the menus that build them, so 452's extra row parameters and wrapper builder no longer break downloads.
  * Instagram: Fingerprint coverage now runs against every APK in `binaries/` and also asserts the Tigon, story viewer and in-app browser anchors.
  * Gboard: Restored the Material 3 "Advanced settings" menu on Gboard 18.4.1. The hook follows the `PreferenceHeaderFragment` hierarchy instead of the removed obfuscated method names, injects the entry at the bottom of settings, and cleans up the "Rate us" / "Help & feedback" rows again.

## 3.3.1

- `NexFusion` 3.3.1:
  * Spotify: Added "Unlock Spotify Premium" patch, ported from `yobreehs/yfimeF`/Femify: account attribute overrides unlock on-demand playback, unforced shuffle, unlimited skips and the Premium settings UI, and restore the popular tracks on artist pages. Every hook installs independently, so a moved anchor on a new Spotify version only disables that block. Ships disabled because Spotify restricts accounts that use modified clients (issue #3); enable it in NexAlloy explicitly.
  * Spotify: "Hide ad sections" now also removes the embedded brand-ad card from the now playing view feed.
  * Spotify: Added fingerprints for the product state, artist query parameters, Google Assistant context and now playing feed, validated against Spotify 9.1.90.2270 and 9.1.92.3058.
  * NOTICE: Added attribution for the ReVanced/Femify premium material.

- `NexAlloy` & `NexFusion` 3.2.6:
  * YouTube: Ported latest fixes and updates from Morphe `dev` branch:
    - **Miniplayer**: Watch transition animation fix (prevents feed from jumping or rendering black when expanding/collapsing player) and "Play next/last in queue" from feeds fix.
    - **Video Quality**: Added initial video quality and SABR stream constraint overrides to prevent video quality from dropping during playback.
    - **Navigation Bar**: Added translucent navigation bar overrides to fix raised navigation bar and empty bottom gap.
    - **Status Bar**: Added `Hide StatusBar` patch with explicit *"Fix status bar covering the top bars"* layout setting.

    - **Visual/Theme**: Light theme readability fixes for comments button page indicator dots and metadata panel text contrast.
  * Submodules: Pinned `morphe-patches` and `morphe-patches-library` to latest remote heads.

## 3.2.5

- `NexFusion` 3.2.5:
  * Gboard: Ported all features from PixelBoard (by Akshay Kadam):
    - **In-Gboard "Advanced settings" Screen**: Full Material 3 dialog integrated directly into Gboard settings (`PreferenceHeaderFragment`) with independent toggles for AI Writing Tools, Support All Keyboards, Enable Advanced Voice Typing, and Material 3 Rounded Keys, plus quick restart button (`↻`) and Akshay Kadam attribution.
    - **Preference Bloat Cleanup**: Automatically stripped "Rate Gboard" and "Help & feedback" from settings screens.
    - **Gemini Rambler Natural Voice Typing**: Real-time speech cleanup (filters fillers/stutters like "um", "ah", "like"), thought completion (on-the-fly corrections), context auto-punctuation and capitalization, and seamless multilingual fluidity.
    - **Direct Boot & Battery Lifecycle Readiness**: Device-Protected Storage (DE) support ensures voice typing is immediately active upon boot without manual restarts (#4), and speech recognition bindings (`GoogleAsrService`) are cleanly released when the keyboard is hidden to eliminate idle battery drain (#3).
    - **Clipboard & UI Enhancements**: Samsung/Vivo clipboard sync (#17) and spellchecker inline chips UI.
  * Gboard: fixed crash in `ModuleManager` on Gboard 18.4.1 beta caused by invalid wildcard `*` language tags, restoring rounded keycaps (Belka UI) and AI Writing Tools.
  * Gboard: decoupled rounded keycaps and AI writing tools preference overrides so each feature can be toggled independently.
  * Gboard: added real-time Phenotype flag override reporting to logcat.

## 3.2.4

- `NexFusion` 3.2.4:
  * Gboard: added support for Gboard 18.4.1 Release (`odx`/`ody` obfuscated phenotype flag getters).
  * Gboard: added "Emogen (GenAI Emoji Maker)" patch to unlock generative AI emoji maker access point and endpoints.
  * Gboard: added "Sign-to-Text (Signboard ASL)" patch for camera-based American Sign Language translation.
  * Gboard: added "Manual Incognito mode toggle" patch to easily toggle incognito typing directly from toolbar access points.
  * Gboard: added "Smart auto-correction & fast learning" patch with primary-key revert on backspace, two-stage decoding, and optimized user history learning rates.
  * Gboard: added "Candidate strip emoji vibrancy" patch ensuring candidate strip emoji glyphs render at full opacity (alpha 255) instead of dull translucent styles.
  * Gboard: expanded "Quick insert" with dynamic multi-view, contacts, clipboard query results, and local image suggestion flags.
  * Gboard: expanded "Screenshot suggestion chips" with extended clipboard history and direct quick paste flags.
  * Gboard: expanded "AI Writing Tools" with staging server endpoints for writing helper and Imagen.

## 3.2.3

- `NexFusion` 3.2.3:
  * Instagram: added system File Manager folder picker (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`) with fallback to direct path editing and reset to default options.
  * Instagram: ported "Hide Follow on stories" from HushGram (#237), keeping stories from accounts you don't follow clean.
  * Reddit: fixed crash when opening notifications and notifications inbox caused by unboxing and null children lists.
  * Reddit: ported Redgifs audio playback and HD resolution patches from Morphe, restoring high-quality sound for Redgifs media.
  * Compatibility: fully tested and validated against Instagram 451.0.0.53.80 and Reddit 2026.41.0.

## 3.2.2

- `NexFusion` 3.2.2:
  * Patch-only release within series `3.2`, manager unchanged at `3.2.0`.
  * CI fix: `InstalledAppAuditTest` no longer fails when `docs/installed-app-patch-audit.md` is absent from the published repo (the file is kept locally).
  * Manager fix: update-check refresh now cancels any in-progress job and debounces rapid taps, so the UI stays fluid.

## 3.2.0

- `NexFusion` 3.2.0:
  * Renamed the custom `a092devs` bundle to `NexFusion Patches` (`nexfusion.nxb`, `io.github.nexalloy.patches.nexfusion`).
  * Initiated coordinated versioning series `3.2` matching NexAlloyNext manager `3.2.0`.
  * Added compatibility series (`3.2`) and minimum manager version (`3.2.0`) metadata for semantic compatibility validation in the manager app.
  * Preserved full support for all existing patch collections and ported features:
    - Instagram (`com.instagram.android` 451.0.0.53.80, 450.0.0.46.79, 447.0.0.55.81): ad & suggestion blocking, ad injector guard, in-app download dialog with custom folders, per-username subfolders, timestamp filenames, DASH audio extraction, ghost story/live viewing, story auto-advance hold, typing status suppression, double-tap like suppression.
    - Spotify (`com.spotify.music`): audio ad muting, ad view & upsell banner suppression, Premium tab hiding, launcher widgets fix, link sanitizer, Material You theme, custom rounded corners.
    - Reddit (`com.reddit.frontpage`): screenshot banner disable, direct links, home-feed auto-refresh disable, transparent navigation bar, upvote score hiding, post view count hiding.
    - Discord (`com.discord` 348.10): crash reporting, telemetry and touch logging, install attribution, advertising identifiers blocking, and system typeface font forcing.
    - X / Twitter (`com.twitter.android` 12.35.0-prod.01): promoted post removal, video downloads unlock, update screen block, telemetry blackholing, premium upsell removal.
    - Gboard, LinkedIn, MiXplorer, and Proton VPN ports maintained with full functionality.

## 2.13.0


- `a092devs` 1.8.2:
  * Instagram (`com.instagram.android` 451.0.0.53.80): added custom download folder configuration,
    allowing users to set any custom base folder path (or reset to `NexAlloyNext/Instagram`).
  * Instagram: redesigned the Download Settings dialog into a smooth, in-place update interface,
    eliminating the flickering dismiss-and-reopen behavior on option toggles.
  * Instagram: added new patches ported from HushGram:
    - `Stop story auto-advance`: keeps stories on screen without advancing automatically until tapped or swiped.
    - `Hide typing status`: suppresses typing indicator packets so other users do not see when you are typing in chats.
    - `Turn off double tap to like`: stops double tapping posts, reels, and comments from liking them, preventing accidental likes while scrolling.
  * Instagram: expanded suggested content filter rules to intercept additional recommendation endpoints.

## 2.12.0

- `a092devs` 1.8.1:
  * Instagram (`com.instagram.android` 451.0.0.53.80): added "Download audio" option to the download
    dialog for reels and videos, saving the audio track as an `.m4a` file directly into
    `Download/NexAlloyNext/Instagram` using DASH manifest stream extraction with native media muxer fallback.
  * Instagram: default download folder path under Downloads is now `Download/NexAlloyNext/Instagram`
    on device storage (with optional poster subfolder when per-username folders are enabled).

## 2.11.0

- `a092devs` 1.8.0:
  * Instagram (`com.instagram.android` 451.0.0.53.80): `Hide ads` and `Hide reels ads` now stop the
    ads that kept showing between reels and in stories. Instagram builds some sponsored items itself
    and inserts them into the feed, where the request filter can never see them; both patches now
    guard that insert (the "ad injector" Piko answers false: the method holding both
    "cross_surface_duplicate_ad" and "Is ad pod", `LX/05gS.A02` on 451) and it reports that nothing
    went in, so no gap is left behind.
  * Instagram: `Hide reels ads` previously blocked nothing, as `/feed/injected_reels_media/` was
    matched by the ADS rule which the patch never enables. The endpoint now matches the REELS_ADS
    rule, `Hide ads` enables both rules, and the filter test pins the mapping.
  * Instagram: the download options have settings now, reachable from the new "Download settings" row
    of the download dialog: the save location (Download, or Pictures and Movies for the gallery), a
    folder per username, and timestamp names (`yyyyMMdd_HHmmss`). They live in the app's own
    preferences and are read once at the start of a download, so nothing polls and nothing reaches
    back to the manager. The poster's username comes from the media's `user` and the user's
    `username` getters pinned by the hash of each key (`Media.A3R` and `User.A8D` on 451); a build
    that renames them falls back to the plain folder and downloads keep working.
  * Spotify (`com.spotify.music`): new app entry carrying the Spotify patches merged from the `2eno`
    bundle — ad muting and hiding (audio, sections, views, player video, playlist, popups and
    context-menu upsells), Premium tab hiding, third-party launcher widgets fix, sharing link
    sanitizer, Dynamic Material You theme and custom rounded corners.
- The `2eno` bundle is merged into `a092devs` and is not published anymore; its extension code is
  vendored in-tree (the `2eno-patches` submodule and its Dependabot updates are gone). Attribution
  is retained in the `a092devs` NOTICE.

## 2.10.0

- The `piko` bundle is removed: it carried only the X hooks for `12.19.1-release.0`, which no longer
  match the maintained X builds, and its Instagram side had already moved to `a092devs` in 2.6.0.
  X coverage is superseded by the kveld9 port in `a092devs` 1.7.0 (`12.35.0-prod.01`). The Piko
  NOTICE is retained verbatim as
  `bundles/a092devs/src/main/java/io/github/nexalloy/a092devs/NOTICE-piko` (the `a092devs` NOTICE
  now points there), so the upstream attribution requirement survives the removal.
- Docs updated for the removal: the README bundle list, the DEVELOPMENT module tree and the
  installed-app audit now credit `a092devs` for Instagram and X instead of the removed bundle.

## 2.9.0

- `a092devs` 1.7.0:
  * X (`com.twitter.android` 12.35.0-prod.01): new app entry with nine runtime ports of
    `kveld9/kveld-extra-morphe-patches` — `Remove Ads`, `Unlock Video Downloads`,
    `Block Update Screen`, `Block Telemetry & Trackers`, `Remove Premium Upsell`,
    `Control Video Auto Scroll`, `DM Debloat`, `Pause Search Suggestions` and
    `Show Sensitive Media`. Per-patch defaults mirror upstream (first five enabled, last four off).
    The upstream manifest and resource edits (permission strips, component disables, Sentry metadata
    removal) have no runtime equivalent and are not ported.
  * NOTICE: adds the `kveld9/kveld-extra-morphe-patches` (GPL-3.0) section covering the X port.

## 2.8.1

- `a092devs` 1.6.1:
  * JioHotstar (`in.startv.hotstar`): the 2.8.0 runtime port has been withdrawn — the patches did not take effect when applied on the device, so the whole port is removed from the bundle: the patch and fingerprint sources, the tests, the app entry and the `durgesh0505/chiggi_morphe_patches` NOTICE section. The 2.8.0 release notes keep the record of what was attempted.

## 2.8.0

- `a092devs` 1.6.0:
  * Facebook (`com.facebook.katana`): the feed funnel now survives the 583 wrapper/body split. The finder pins the two kept parameter types instead of the renamed third one, and follows the wrapper to the static body it delegates to, so "Hide sponsored posts" no longer fails at every app start with 583 installed — which was the source of the recurring "Error while applying the following patches" toast. The hook reads the edge from whichever argument holds it.
  * JioHotstar (`in.startv.hotstar`): new runtime ports of `durgesh0505/chiggi_morphe_patches` for the phone build (26.09.28.2, keeping the upstream TV build 26.06.22.3 as a target) — premium UI unlock (subscribed state, download buttons, playback nudge suppression), video ad removal (SSAI tag cleared in the AdMetadata constructor so the player requests a clean stream, plus the home-feed banner render stopped), screenshot restriction removal, all-codecs/4K checks and the Dolby Vision/HDR capability check forced on, and the device-attestation blob forced to report a clean device (anchored by its 34-String constructor, which survives the class renames; the blob's own flags were verified against the phone build's parameter names). Every finder carries upstream's access flags and was verified against all thirteen dex entries of the phone build. Not ported, with reasons in the bundle sources: Firebase analytics flags (read before runtime hooks exist), the proxy/VPN verdict bypass (renamed lambda anchors), the device-id spoof and the security-state self-report (renamed anchors), and manifest/resource edits.
  * NOTICE: adds the `durgesh0505/chiggi_morphe_patches` entry (GPL-3.0, adapting Paresh-Maheshwari's patches).

## 2.7.0

- `a092devs` 1.5.0:
  * Facebook (`com.facebook.katana`): the feed funnel, the Reels and Watch ad-pool vends, the ad fetches and the telemetry senders are now resolved at runtime with DexKit instead of hooking names that do not exist in release builds. Sponsored reels also cancel the ad-break queries with a failed future, block the anchorable client-side splices, and stop the deferred-card ad-break poller.
  * Instagram (`com.instagram.android`): the patches now ride on the Tigon request filter and real framework anchors; the direct-message stubs, the log-only patches and the old download stub are gone. The open-links-externally patch anchors on Instagram's own in-app browser, keeps Instagram-family pages and ad links in the app, follows redirect shims and strips only the click id. The download options of the post, sheet, story, highlight and profile-picture menus are restored from this repository's Piko bundle and registered.
  * NOTICE: adds the piko entry (GPL-3.0, NOTICE retained) and corrects the Hushfacebook and HushGram entries.
- `2eno`: repaired the Spotify hide-ad-views patch against 9.1.90.2270, which previously hooked names absent from the release build and silently did nothing.

## 2.6.0

- `a092devs` 1.4.0:
  * Integrated comprehensive Instagram (`com.instagram.android`) patch suite ported from `SysAdminDoc/HushGram`, targeting `451.0.0.53.80`, `450.0.0.46.79`, and `447.0.0.55.81`:
    - Hide ads: suppresses sponsored posts, feed ad units (`INTENT_AWARE_AD_PIVOT`, `STAND_ALONE_MULTI_AD_PIVOT`), injected reels, and profile ads.
    - Hide suggested posts & reels: filters explore chaining, suggestions in feed, and recommended accounts.
    - Ghost mode: anonymous story viewing (blocks `media/seen/` receipts), anonymous live watching (blocks heartbeat presence pings), anonymous DMs (blocks seen/read receipts), and disables typing indicators.
    - Privacy: removes `FLAG_SECURE` for screenshots and screen recordings in disappearing chats, blocks screenshot detection callbacks and observers, sanitizes tracking tags (`igsh`, `utm_*`, `fbclid`) from share URLs, bypasses in-app browser to open links externally, and disables analytics/telemetry.
    - Download any media without watermarks, ask before like, ask before refresh, and unlocked developer options.
  * Expanded Facebook (`com.facebook.katana`) patches ported from `SysAdminDoc/Hushfacebook` targeting `582.0.0.50.54` and `581.0.0.45.54`:
    - Hide sponsored posts, feed ads, comment sheet ad pills, sponsored reels, and marketplace ads.
    - Block ad telemetry, background ad prefetch jobs, and advertising ID tracking sinks.
    - Bypass in-app browser to open links in default system browser, and download media.
- `piko`:
  * Migrated Instagram patches into `a092devs.nxb` to focus solely on X (Twitter).
- Repository maintenance:
  * Removed untracked/redundant `reports/` directory from commit tree and updated `.gitignore`.

## 2.5.0

- `a092devs` 1.4.0:
  * Expanded Proton VPN (`ch.protonvpn.android`) runtime patches ported from `hxreborn/morphe-patches` and `hoo-dles/morphe-patches`:
    - Remove server change delay: eliminates cooldown wait periods between server switching on free plans (`AppConfigResponse`).
    - Unlock advanced settings & NetShield: unlocks NetShield ad/tracker blocking, split tunneling (app & IP routing), custom DNS, and allow LAN connections.
    - Suppress upgrade promotions: eliminates onboarding upgrade dialogs, promotional alerts, and account upgrade banners.
    - Updated verified compatibility targets to include `5.20.74.0`, `5.20.57.0`, and `5.20.39.0` alongside `5.19.x`.

## 2.4.0

- `nexalloy` 1.0.7: ported four runtime player and layout patches from Morphe/yollAmeF:
  * Ambient Mode: options to bypass power-saving restrictions and disable Ambient mode dimming in fullscreen.
  * Miniplayer: modern miniplayer flag overrides, horizontal drag support, and offscreen repositioning hooks.
  * Picture-in-picture seek buttons: rewind and forward (±5s) controls injected directly into Android Picture-in-Picture window actions.
  * Disable playlist autoplay: suppresses automatic queue advancement to the next playlist video.
- `a092devs` 1.3.0:
  * Proton VPN (`ch.protonvpn.android`): runtime patches ported from Paresh-Patches to disable telemetry/observability workers, suppress upgrade onboarding dialogs, and unlock NetShield UI feature availability.
  * Gboard (`com.google.android.inputmethod.latin`): expanded with dynamic Phenotype flag class detection and SharedPreferences hook for Belka rounded keycaps, Gemini AI writing tools, Scan Text OCR, floating screenshot chips, Emoji Palette V2, Smart Compose predictions, and spellchecker suggestion chips from PixelBoard.
- `2eno`: Spotify runtime updates for APS banner handling, upsell suppression, and fingerprint stability.

## 2.3.0

- `nexalloy`: version-gated fingerprint updates for YouTube 21.41 (background playback settings,
  player type target and the shorts-resume constructor split).
- `a092devs`: Discord "Use your phone's font" option (ReactFontManager system-typeface hook ported
  from Venus Patches; off by default) and seven Reddit runtime ports from Adobo — screenshot-banner
  disable, external links without `out.reddit.com`, home-feed auto-refresh disable, home-screen
  redirect disable, transparent navigation bar, upvote-score hiding and post view-count hiding.
  The Reddit matchers were verified against 2026.41.0 fingerprints; score/view-count/nav-bar and
  auto-refresh ports are opt-in, and the score/view-count ports stub getters only (upstream also
  rewrites toString fields, which runtime hooks cannot).
- `a092devs` 1.2.0: three new app tables ported as runtime hooks. Gboard 18.4.1 gets 13 flag
  patches (cursor trackpad, quick insert, emoji size, access points menu redesign, Bluetooth
  microphone, close proactive suggestions, access point count, clipboard character limit, flow
  mode, advanced voice typing, grammar checker, inline suggestions, key shapes) from
  jasonwu1994/Gboard-patches; all of them share one flag-getter hook, and the access point count
  and advanced voice patches are off by default. Facebook 582 gets allow-screenshots and
  block-screenshot-detection from SysAdminDoc/Hushfacebook. LinkedIn gets hide sponsored
  messages, ghost mode typing indicator and read receipts, disable double-tap like and hide feed
  ads from heyymichii/michii-patches. The parts that need patch-time resources are not ported
  (Gboard OCR plumbing and AI writing tools, LinkedIn DownloadMedia, the Facebook feed patches);
  each bundle's NOTICE lists the ported material per source.
- Repository tooling: release notes now come from this changelog, and a push to `main` dispatches
  the release for the first version section automatically.
